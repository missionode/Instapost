## Frontend
- **HTML5 & CSS3:** For structural and stylistic foundation.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** For form logic, `localStorage` management, and dynamic prompt generation.
- **Bootstrap 5 (CDN):** For a responsive, mobile-first UI framework with pre-built components.
- **Tailwind CSS (Optional/CDN):** Can be used alongside Bootstrap for fine-tuned utility styling if needed.

## Data Persistence
- **Web Storage API (localStorage):** Used to persist user-specific brand data and form state across sessions.

## Testing
- **Jest:** For unit and integration testing.
- **jest-environment-jsdom:** To simulate a browser environment for DOM testing.

## Deployment & Hosting
- **Static Site Hosting:** The application can be hosted on platforms like GitHub Pages, Vercel, or Netlify as it requires no backend.

# Initial Concept
The project is "Instapost", a context-aware tool to generate high-fidelity luxury Instagram posters using a dynamic semantic blueprint system.

Key Features:
- **Surgical Single-Point Entry UI:** Eliminates constraint collision by forcing a single design path (Festive, Artisan, or AI's Choice).
- **Artisan Collection Builder:** A dynamic row-based interface for Artisan mode that allows users to explicitly pair garment URLs with specific model categories (Men, Women, Kids) for surgical precision.
- **Advanced Contextual Engine:**
    - **Multi-Subject Composition:** Intelligent handling of multiple models with category-specific attire directives.
    - **Group Mode:** Automatic grid expansion to full-width when multiple subjects or references are detected.
    - **Artisan Fidelity (9.5+ Score):** Advanced micro-level embroidery protection and mannequin suppression.
- **Persistent Marketing Content:** Hooks and offers remain visible and integrated across all design paths.
- Prompt Generation: Outputs complex, structured JSON blueprints optimized for high-end diffusion models.
- Persistence & Portability: `localStorage` integration with JSON export/import for database management.

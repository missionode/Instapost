# Initial Concept
The project is "Instapost", a context-aware tool to generate high-fidelity luxury Instagram posters using a dynamic semantic blueprint system.

Key Features:
- **Modern Flat Design UI:** A minimalist, high-contrast interface optimized for mobile-first workflows, using 100% sans-serif typography (Inter).
- **Surgical Single-Point Entry:** Eliminates constraint collision by forcing a single design path (Festive, Artisan, or AI's Choice).
- **Horizontal Action Bars:** Strategic placement of engine toggles (AI Copy, Logo) for better accessibility and reachability on mobile devices.
- **Visual Format Tiles:** An intuitive, 3-column grid system for selecting output formats (Square, Portrait, Reel), complete with platform-specific icons and aspect ratio subtitles.
- **Artisan Collection Builder:** A dynamic row-based interface for Artisan mode that allows users to explicitly pair garment URLs with specific model categories.
- **Advanced Contextual Engine:**
    - **Semantic Blueprinting:** Generates descriptive "Design Blueprints" for production-grade AI.
    - **Artisan Fidelity (9.5+ Score):** Advanced micro-level embroidery protection and mannequin suppression.
    - **Regional Context Integration:** Subtly aligns model features and regional styling with the South Asian Indian background of the provided location.
- Prompt Generation: Outputs complex, structured JSON blueprints optimized for high-end diffusion models.
- Persistence & Portability: `localStorage` integration with JSON export/import for database management.

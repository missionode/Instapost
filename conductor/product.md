# Initial Concept
The project is "Instapost", a context-aware tool to generate high-fidelity luxury Instagram posters using a dynamic semantic blueprint system.

Key Features:
- **Surgical Single-Point Entry UI:** Eliminates "ghost data" and constraint collision by forcing a single design path:
    - **Festive Spotlight:** Focused on cultural and seasonal authenticity.
    - **Artisan Spotlight:** Focused on 1:1 garment fidelity (Artisan Fidelity).
    - **AI's Choice:** Full creative freedom for the AI based on marketing content.
- **Mutual Exclusivity Logic:** Automatically clears inactive design anchors when switching modes to ensure a laser-focused prompt.
- **Persistent Marketing Content:** Hooks and offers remain visible and integrated across all design paths.
- **Advanced Contextual Engine:**
    - **Semantic Blueprinting:** Generates descriptive "Design Blueprints" for production-grade AI.
    - **Artisan Fidelity (9.5+ Score):** Advanced embroidery protection and mannequin suppression.
- Prompt Generation: Outputs complex, structured JSON blueprints optimized for high-end diffusion models.
- Persistence & Portability: `localStorage` integration with JSON export/import for database management.

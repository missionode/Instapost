# Initial Concept
The project is "Instapost", a context-aware tool to generate high-fidelity luxury Instagram posters using a dynamic semantic blueprint system.

Key Features:
- **Priority-Anchor UI (The Priority Triangle):** Users eliminate constraint collision by selecting a single primary design anchor:
    - **Festive Spotlight:** Prioritizes cultural and seasonal authenticity.
    - **Artisan Spotlight:** Anchors the entire aesthetic to a specific garment for 1:1 fidelity (Artisan Fidelity).
    - **AI's Choice:** Full creative freedom for the AI based on brand intent.
- **Persistent Marketing Content:** Hooks and offers are always visible and integrated into any chosen anchor.
- **Advanced Contextual Engine:**
    - **Semantic Blueprinting:** Replaced rigid style templates with a dynamic hierarchy that generates a descriptive "Design Blueprint" for the AI.
    - **Artisan Fidelity (9.5+ Score Refinements):** Includes micro-level embroidery protection, mannequin artifact suppression, and optimized pose physics.
- Prompt Generation: The form generates a complex, structured JSON prompt blueprint for production-grade AI image generation.
- Persistence: Use `localStorage` to remember semi-static fields like Brand, Location Details, and Social Handles.
- Data Management: Options to download and upload the database for easy backup and restore.
